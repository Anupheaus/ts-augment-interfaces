## Base

This package defines how the `createProperties` function should work.   It allows the user to create properties with definitions.

## Augmenter

I would like this package to somehow augment the property definitions described in the base package.

## User

I would like this package to use the `createProperties` function and when it comes to creating the definition for a house, it should have all the original properties and the augmented properties ideally.
